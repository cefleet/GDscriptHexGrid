# GDscriptHexGrid
A hex grid engine with a* pathfinding included

This was the first thing I did in GD script so it really could be much better. However I was asked to share it and I am willing to.
I had started to re-write it in c++ but never finshed it so that is included as well. This is the only thing I have ever written in c++ so don't judge me.


**Usage for GDscript:**
```python
var HexAPI = load("res://'folderToGDscriptHexGrid'/HexAPI.gd").new()
var to = HexAPI.engine._hex(q,r,s)
var from = HexAPI.engine._hex(q,r,s)
var obstacles = [HexAPI.engine._hex(q,r,s),HexAPI.engine._hex(q,r,s),HexAPI.engine._hex(q,r,s)]
var hexes = HexAPI.astar._aStarGetPathTo(from,to, obstacles)
```

**Notes for c++ **
- Astar does not work ...Not really going to make it work.
- hex and points are literally just Vector3 and Vector2 respectivly. I never understood how to make my own variant or if I should even try.
- I don't know c++, so this is bad c++
