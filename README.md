# GDscriptHexGrid
A hex grid engine with a* pathfinding included

This was the first thing I did in GD script so it really could be much better. However I was asked to share it and I am willing to.
I had started to re-write it in c++ but never finshed it so that is included as well. This is the only thing I have ever written in c++ so don't judge me.
